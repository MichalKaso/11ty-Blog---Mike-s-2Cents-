    <h2>Words From The Author:</h2>
    <p>This wasn't supposed to be a blog. It shouldn't even exist. Basically, i was trying to understand 11ty, thus thought reacting a blog was the way to go. Funny enough, with each step of the building process, i combined my love for coding with my love for writing, and voila, i guess i have a blog now. Funny how life turns out, no?  </p>
