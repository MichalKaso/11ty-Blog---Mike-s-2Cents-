<p>Let this simple blog post serve as a reminder. A reminder to myself, of the day i decided to quit my career in Finance and make my way into the tech business as a developer. </p>
<h2>This is the reminder, if you ever needed one.</h2>

<p class="no-top no-bottom">It all came about very randomly, however, i can say it is the best decision i've done lately. Im actually proud of myself.</p>

<p>Listen, i've worked in Marketing, and recently coming out of a 4 year career in Finance. It STILL amazes me that i can read code. That i can understand code and make projects, silly ones, but also functional ones. Sky's the limit really. </p>

<p>Naturally, putting in 6-8 hours per day, the past 6 months, while holding a full time job, has been challenging, however, now, i feel like i can do everything, with nothing, forever. Yeah!</p>
